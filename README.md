# Darkmode Toggle

This **does not** actually add darkmode to your site. It does provide a toggle
and a class to target so that you can write a bit of CSS yourself for your theme
to make it all work.

It does store the preference of the user in Local Storage and uses that to keep
their selection around.

For your CSS target `.darkmode--activated` on your body class.

That is all.
